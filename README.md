# #GovJam: Weekend Web Challenge with DIA
(the following is paraphrased/stolen directly from the [SoT Blog](https://summeroftech.co.nz/blog/events/govjam-weekend-web-challenge-dia/))

Earlier this year, the Department of Internal Affairs approached us to bring in some fresh thinking to the govt.nz website.

Their goals are to help people:

 - receive information and seamless public services they need in the way that’s best for them 
 - to trust public services supported by a unified government approach

We worked through a service design process, with Maia & Neve from Alphero getting everyone’s Design Thinking mojo on with a quick session on Saturday morning.

As we worked through the stages of empathising, defining & ideating on Saturday, we followed an agile approach, with regular stand ups and check ins to make sure everyone was communicating and working well together.

# Our Focus

> Providing government service information in a more accessible, simplified, concise and personalised manner to people who are otherwise dismayed by visiting government websites for accessing information.

Team 2Down (us) identified a user persona who needs to access government health services, but doesn’t love technology. Sid & Danton went OUTSIDE to test their wireframes on members of the public – Sunday morning supermarket shoppers! The feedback was strong: people don’t want a website, they just want to talk to someone who can solve their problem NOW.

For our solution, the team focused on front end development, and our biggest challenge was building a data model with all possible services (in such a short timeframe). We considered accessibility issues and the best ways to provide a single portal for users to find the information and services they need.
